    "In this task we want to explore the physics of a bouncing ball.\n",

    "This task featured the disipline of physics. More specifically, Mechanics. The task aims to highlight computational thinking in the context of a bouncing ball. How can we describe each time step of a ball falling towards the ground and bouncing up again. The students are given a set of formulaes and constants in mathematical notation which they are to use in their discription of this process. "

    "### What happens when you drop a ball?\n",
    "When we drop a ball it goes through the following stages (simplified):\n",
    "1. The ball is dropped from a height `Y`. Gravity forces the ball towards the ground. The ball has negative volocity in this stage.\n",
    "2. The ball hits the ground at height `0`. At this moment it's velocity is `0`. As per Newton's third law:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \"Every force or action has an equal and opposite reaction.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   the ball is pushed upwards off the ground, with positive volocity.\n",
    "4. As the ball travels upwards it reaches its maximal displacement, decelerates, and changes the direction of motion from upwards to downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "These stages are repeated while the ball experiences damping, where it loses potential energy and kinetic energy as it falls. This causes the amplitude of the height to reduce over time and eventually come to a stop.\n",
